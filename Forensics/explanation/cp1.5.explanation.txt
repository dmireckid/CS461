For the attacker's IP, we egrepped for IP addresses in "var/log/auth.log" and searched for any failed (and successful) outside ssh attempts, jotting down the IP addresses that show up. We also found the time of the first attack by looking for the first attempt for ssh login.
For the victim's IP, we grepped for "address" in the "var/log/syslog" file and located the line specifying the IP address assignment for the laptop that's closest to the time of the first attack
Another option we did was egrep for IP addresses in "var/log/syslog" and find the line closest to the start of the attack time and associated with the victim's IP address
