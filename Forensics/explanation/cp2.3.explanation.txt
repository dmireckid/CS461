Like on the victim's computer, we also performed an fls command on the raw disk to locate the files that contain the string "chat.org". After finding the files, we performed an icat command on each of them via their inode number to look at the content, and respectively wrote down each file containing a conversation.
The inodes we found that contained "chat.org" were:
171063
179007
179008
132550- with user peter.plum (11-02 19:50:36)
132406- with user peter.plum (11-03 09:57:46)
132695
177338(realloc)
179008(realloc)
Just to make sure, we also performed a live analysis on the suspect's computer and looked in the chat history for the Pidgin app.
