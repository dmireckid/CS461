The Honorable Tim Wadsworth
Chairman
Select Committee on Intelligence
United States Senate

Dear Chairman Wadsworth,

I am reporting an “urgent concern” in accordance with the procedures outlined in 50 U.S.C section 3033(k)(5)(A). In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple trusted sources that Senator Elizabeth Peacock is using the power of her office to solicit illegal donations from foreign entities. This includes, among other things, accepting money and other gifts from foreign countries in exchange for classified government information. I was a direct witness to many of the events.

I am deeply concerned that the actions described constitute “a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order”. I am therefore fulfilling my duty to report this information, through proper legal channels, to the relevant authorities.

Yours Faithfully,
John Boddy.
